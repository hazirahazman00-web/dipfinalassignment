Sir, for the Teamwork & Collaboration component, our group divided responsibilities into Image Processing Development and Pre-processing & Enhancement Analysis to ensure efficient collaboration and a clear technical workflow.

[NUR HAZIRAH BINTI AZMAN] – Core Image Processing & Thresholding Development

Developed the initial image processing pipeline, including image loading, grayscale conversion, and both static and Otsu thresholding techniques for handwriting segmentation.

Conducted comparative testing between static thresholding and Otsu thresholding to evaluate robustness under different lighting conditions and background variations.

Verified the consistency of binarization results across multiple handwritten samples to ensure the method was suitable for real-world document images.

[NURUL ATIEQAH AMIERA BINTI IBRAHIM] – Morphological Processing & Result Optimization

Designed and implemented morphological operations such as opening and closing to reduce noise and improve stroke continuity in handwritten text.

Analyzed the effect of different kernel sizes on handwriting clarity, ensuring important stroke details were preserved while removing unwanted artifacts.

Optimized the visual presentation of results, including side-by-side comparisons of original, grayscale, thresholded, and morphologically processed images.

Collaborative Contribution

Both members worked closely during the parameter tuning phase, adjusting threshold values and morphological settings to achieve the best balance between noise removal and stroke preservation.

Jointly reviewed intermediate outputs to ensure the final processed images were clear, readable, and suitable for potential applications such as OCR and document digitization.
