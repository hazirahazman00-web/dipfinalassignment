PROBLEM STATEMENT
In real-life, handwritten documents like exam scripts, forms, or notes often need to be digitized.

These images usually have uneven lighting, background noise, or unclear handwriting, making automated analysis difficult.
This project focuses on extracting handwritten text from such real-world images for reliable processing and recognition.

  PROJECT CONTENT
  This project focuses on extracting handwritten text from real-world images.

The objective is to separate handwriting from the background and enhance its quality for further analysis such as OCR and document digitization.

  CONCLUSION

The project successfully segments handwritten text from real-world images using image processing techniques.

 Grayscale conversion simplifies the image, thresholding separates text from the background, and morphological operations clean noise and enhance stroke continuity.

 Otsu thresholding adapts to lighting, making this method suitable for diverse handwriting styles and real-world conditions.

 This approach is valuable for OCR, digitizing documents, and any application requiring reliable handwriting recognition.
